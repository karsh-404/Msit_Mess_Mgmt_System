# Msit_Mess_Mgmt_System
This Mess management system for college is based on IoT and utilises the technology of NFC tags.
It is used to keep track of the meals had by a student.
It also monitors the students entering and leaving the mess, prohibiting unauthorised access.
There are seperate panels for students and admins and new students may be added through admin panel.
